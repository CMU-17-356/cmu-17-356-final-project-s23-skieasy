## About üîà 
Looking to hit the slopes without breaking the bank? Our web application connects CMU students looking to rent ski and snowboard equipment, allowing you to enjoy winter sports without the hassle and expense of purchasing your own gear.

## How We Work üèóÔ∏è 

### Problem
You cannot join friends plans to go skiing on the weekend because:
1. You do not have equipment
2. You cannot rent at an affordable price
3. You do not want to wait in line at the mountain to rent equipment

### Solution
SkiEasy is a web application where ski equipment can be rented, acts as CMU marketplace for ski equipment <br>
Users can put up for rent any ski equipment they have such as gloves, pants, jackets, poles, snowboards, helmets, and skis <br>
Users can search for equipment nearby to make it easy to pick up

### Implementation
Simple web application developed with Django
Users can:
* Create a profile to post and/or rent equipment
* Contact other users to ask about their equipment
* Review other users and their equipment
* Do an advanced search based on location, price, size, and equipment
